<h1>About Me</h1> 



Hi, I'm a web developer with a passion for crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, primarily working with technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Laravel**, **React**, and **Inertia.js** to build full-stack web applications.

With a keen eye for design and a focus on performance, I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. I’m always excited to learn new technologies and improve my skills, and I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality code that meets the needs of users and clients alike.

Take a look at my projects, and let's build something great together!

<h2>Current Focus</h2>
<br/>
<p>I'm currently focusing on improving my skills in **React.js** and learning more about **Inertia.js** to better connect the back-end and front-end. I'm also deepening my knowledge of **design systems** and UI/UX principles to make user experiences even better!</p>
